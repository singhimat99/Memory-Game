# Memory-Game

PROBLEM:

- create a game in whci there are 6 cards
- each card is 'facing down' with an image on the other side'
- user has to pick two cards at random and see if the images match
- if they do match alert them that they won, and randomize the images underneath the cards
- if they do not match, unflip the flipped cards and continue the game
- track how many tries it took for user to win, maybe add it to the alert

BREAKDOWN:
{brainstorm: - listen for user clicks on images - have image files at least six of em, prolly 7 actually - check if images macth, so checkWin() function - function that changes image upon click - some way to randomize images - a way to access images via random number}

1. find images of animals
2. save them to this folder, and rename them with numbers
3. display images on screen
4. find way to randomize which images are displayed, from javascript (function)
5. find way to change img src upon click (function)
6. check if images match (function)
7. reset game when won or upon click of a button (function)
8. style everything to make it better
